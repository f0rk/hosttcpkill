Kill a TCP connection to a particular host, the lazy way

Given a particular host and pid, tries to find an open TCP connection to it,
and then interrupt the connection with tcpkill.

Requires python, lsof, and tcpkill (from dsniff) to be installed.

Examples:

Find and kill a connection to foo.bar.com:
~$ hosttcpkill 123 foo.bar.com

Find and kill the connection to foo.bar.com where the destination port is 80:
~$ hosttcpkill --port 80 123 foo.bar.com

Don't actually kill anything, just print what we would do:
~$ hosttcpkill --dry-run 123 foo.bar.com
